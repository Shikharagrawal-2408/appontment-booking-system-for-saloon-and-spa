Salon & Spa Appointment Booking Website
Overview

This project is a static appointment booking website designed for a salon and spa. It focuses on clean layout, user-friendly design, and responsive structure using only HTML and CSS.
There is no backend, no JavaScript, and no real booking logic — this is purely a front-end project.

If you’re expecting dynamic slots, database integration, or form handling, this project does not do that.

Features

Home page with salon & spa introduction

Services section (hair, spa, beauty, etc.)

Appointment booking form (UI only)

Clean and minimal design

Responsive layout using CSS

Simple navigation structure

Tech Stack

HTML5 – page structure

CSS3 – styling and layout

Nothing else. No frameworks. No libraries.

How It Works

Users can view services and fill an appointment form

The form is not functional — it does not store or submit data

This project demonstrates UI design and layout skills, not full-stack development

Purpose of This Project

Practice HTML & CSS

Understand page layout and styling

Build a real-world themed static website

Suitable for beginners in web development

Limitations (Be Honest)

No backend

No database

No form validation

No real booking functionality

This is intentional.

Future Improvements

If you want to turn this into a real product:

Add JavaScript for form validation

Integrate a backend (Node.js / PHP / Firebase)

Store appointments in a database

Add admin panel

Enable real-time slot availability
